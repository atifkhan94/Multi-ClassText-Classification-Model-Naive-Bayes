# Multi-ClassText-Classification-Model-Naive-Bayes
Text classification is a common Natural Language Processing (NLP) task where we assign predefined categories to text documents. One of the most efficient and widely used algorithms for this task is the Naïve Bayes classifier. It is based on Bayes' Theorem with an assumption of independence between features (words in the text).

Naïve Bayes is particularly useful for text classification problems due to its simplicity, efficiency, and good performance on small datasets. It is often used for applications like spam detection, sentiment analysis, and topic categorization.
